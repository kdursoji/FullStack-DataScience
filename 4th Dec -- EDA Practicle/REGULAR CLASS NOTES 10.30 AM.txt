interpreter vs compiler
overview again on how to install anaconda software
python basic code onwards

1st time learner & 2nd time learn i will take back up classes for 4days
	I will share recording so that you can review 
	
1st - I will also share some on install software video 


on daily basis you need notes, project, codes, task from me

how do i share all the document to  10:30am batch 

the learner who know python good

I 80% stren of this batch 0 knowledge 

====
- revision for previous classes
- i wll share the recording for 4 classes

python is best programming to choose to build ds, ai, gen ai, llm  developer, prompt project

== install the software 
	👩‍💻Python Software Installation Process
		Link: https://t.ly/F_VOW

== I will tell you again how to install python software 

1- Type google 
2- Anaconda python 
3- Enter your registered email
4- Download clip -- downlod the software 
5- Install the software (min space - 5gb) 
6- start -- anaconda folder -- expand the folder 
	anaconda navigator -- done 
	anaconda command prompt -- 
	jupyter notebook
	spyder 
	
anaconda navigator is the hub of anaconda enterprise where 
user or developer can launch any software by click it.
base - root 

---
ANACONDA COMMAND PROMPT -->
--
 user or developer can install package or library 
 user can write python code 
 user or dev can upgrade or downgra library for specific project 

---
jupyter 
---
 write the code, run the code, debug the code 

--- 
spyder 
---
write the code, run the code, debug the code user can see the variable

python introduction 
python ide 
python interpreter 
python compiler
start the basic code 

=== PYTHON INTRODUCTION ====

1- pytho is object oriented programin languare 
	a = 5 | in memory we created object called a which store value 5


2- python name coined from --
		'complete monty python's flying circus'' - 
		broadcasted in BBC channel

3- Father of python - guido van rosam 
	this guy he is workig as microsoft developer 

4- python borrowed concept from c, c++, jave 
	so thats why python is powerfull langau next 10yr
 every year new python library introduce new feature to handle
	generative & llm model & prompt engineering 
	
5- Python developed in NRI - (Netherland) by researcher 

6- Java released on 1995. 
	python was released on 1989 (but no one used at that time)
		feb 20th 1991 - python first released date
		
7- every orgnization used now cuz ml, ai, pe, gen ai, llm developer

8- 5day chatgpt -- create 1millin user 
	backbone of chatgpt is AI & GENERATIVE AI

9- 	everyone even client wants to write very less code

10- pvm(python virtual machine) 

11- python is dynamic programming language
		no need to assign any datatpye, indentation after :
		
12- python cons -- we cannot used in mobile device 

13- cpython , jpython, iron python, ruby python
	bigdata & datascience  -- anaconda python
	
14- Python 1.0 introduce in jan 1994 -- Noorganization is working now
	Python 2.0 introduce in oct 2000 -- Noorganization is working now
	Python 3.0 introduce in Dec 2008, 
	2016, 2017,---- latest version - 
	3.6, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11

python introduce is completd

=== python ide ==
integrated development environment

user write the code , run the code, debugg the code

	jupyter notebook 
	spyder
	vscode 
	pycharm 
	
==== python interpreter vs python compiler ====

run the code line by line -- interpreter 
whole code run at once -- compiler 

python programming is --> BOTH interpreter  & compiler 


=== python basic code ====

python variabel or python identifier or python object

identifier = variable = object 
---
syntax -->
---
 <identifier name> = value (data types)
 
 value --> integer value | int datatypes
			float value | float datatypes 
			complex value | complex data types
			string value | string datatypes
			boolean value | bool datatypes 

function() -- ends with()

VARIABEL  - doesnot define with ()
FUNCTION - define with ()

***** 4th ******

sesson we started just 5 days back 

6th day -- 
i will take the backup classes for you & i covere 5 day session

i will share all the 5 day recording to you.

we start python programmin for basic level 

end of the class i will unmute for 1st time student if you have any question 
----
sat what are the topic i covered excel sheet 
---
full stack ds with genai, prompt engineer

====== python identifier | python variable | python object

identifier = variable = object 
----
syntax of identifier -->
----
(Identifier name = Variable) = value 

v = 5 
v - varibale 
5 - value 

print() or without print()

when user has only 1 variabe --> not required 
when code has more then 1 variable -- print() is requestion 

====
function()
- inbuild function or buildin function 
- user define function -- def keyword 
====
print() -- print the value of the identier or value
id() - address of the memory location of identifier or value 

# -- comment ( is it realyy important)

join new comany -->
	some one quit the job ( then you get exper job)
	any project introduce ( they hired fresher)
	
prompt engineer 
	1cr (prompt engineer intern) 
	
new job -- some one alree write the code 

review the code # print # abstraction # inher 

# today u write the code 

-- new student ( backup classes)
-- python intro, ide, inter vs complier
-- print()
-- inbuild funct() -- print(), id()
-- identifier = variable = object
-- # -- comment benefit of comment
-- non techn how to memory the code (dont by heart)
---
RULES TO DEFINE PYTHON IDENTIFIER -->
---

1 - identifier is case sensitive 
2- identifier is never start with digit 		
3- no special charate is allowed 
4- only _ is allowed 
5- keyword will never be an identifier
	keyword = reserved word (35)
=====
	'False', 'None',  'True',  'and',  'as',  'assert',
	'async', 'await',  'break',  'class',  'continue',
	'def',  'del',  'elif',  'else',  'except',  'finally',
	'for',  'from',  'global',  'if',  'import',  'in',
	'is',  'lambda',  'nonlocal',  'not',  'or',
	'pass',  'raise',  'return',  'try',  'while',  'with',  'yield']
=====
	if any learner complet 35 keyword -- python programming is completed 
6- identifier has no lenght limit
=== pythoon identifier completed =====

**** 5th *****

if i share any document please check the extension

pdf - .pdf 
.ipynb -- (extension of code file how to open the )
.py -- extension of code file 

(identifier name) = value 

what is identifier ?
what is the rules to define identifier ?

values == data types 
integer value or int datatypes
float value or float datatype
string value or string datatype
bool value or bool datatype
complex value or complex datype 

int datatypes = value without decimal  
float datatypes = value with decmial 
					only e letter is allowed 


python software installed 
	anaconda python --- bigdata & datascience, gen ai, 
ptyhon ide -- vs code, pycharm, jupyter, spyder
interpreter - execute code line by line
complier - execute entire code at once
identifer -- syntax, rules to define identifer
fun():
    4 indentiation 
python is dynamic 

7 session -- 1 day coding classes started 
	
number - (1, 2,3)  --> statistic numerical data
	
text - 'a', -- stats (categorical data)

numerical data vs categorical data 

	string -- '' || " " | ''' '''
 ''' ''' -- use for multiline comments

=== python data type we are completes

TYPE CASTING ---> 
	CONVERT ONE DATATYPE OTHER DATATYPES
---
ARGUMENT OR PARAMETER ===
---
FAM - VARIABLE 
FAMILY() -- function without argument 

family(m,d) -- 2 argument or 2 parameter 
family1(m,d,s,d)

function with argument 

------
add(x,y) - fun 2 argument 
div() - fun no argument 
mul(a,b,c) - mul with 3 argument 
----
--
type casting -->
--
Steps to download class notes from google classroom -->
---
1 - google download winzip or winrar
2- install winrar 
3- click the file -- right click 3 dots
4- download option - download
5- rightclick - winrar - extract the file 

****** 6th ******
demo session we completed
student who are new i will take the backup classes
python identifier
python data types

---
TYPE CASTING --->
---
1- Other data type to int  ---> 
		string with text & complex cannot casting to int 
		but rest of the data type we can able cast to int
2- Other data type to float -->
	string with text & complex cannot casting to float 
	but rest of the data type we can able cast to float
3- Other data type to complex
	 string only numbers allowe also only 1 string is acceptable
	 other datatype to complex 
4- other data type to bool
	we can casting from other data type to bool
	non zero argument -- always give you true
	zero arugment -- alwasy give you false
5- other data type to string
	we can casting from other data type to string

=====
PYTHON OPERATORS 
---
ARITHMETIC OPERATOR (+, -, *, /, //,  %, ** )
ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=)
RELATIONAL OPERATOR ( using this operator for comparing)
	> < >= <= == !=
LOGICAL OPERATOR  and, or, not 
UNARY OPERATOR -

and table | or table | not table 
	
and table 
 1 & 1 is 1 rest of them are 0

string --> done 
indexing, slicing --> done 
home work -- very powerfull
	once you will practicle that code 
python data structure 

' ' | " " | ''' '''

INDEXING --> python index begins with 0 (n-1)

forward index --> left to right ( index start with 0)
backward index --> right to left ( index start with -1)

slicing --> : 
: - print all elements or entire string 
2:5 -- print values from 2nd index to 5th index (5-1)
:5 -- print values starting to 5th index (5-1) 
5: -- print the vales from 5th index to last 
::-1 -- REVERS THE STRING 
0:10:2

====
not a problem at all -- revie the recording and complet the prevous codes 
===

data type vs data structure vs matrix 

a = 5 || b = 5,6,7 || c = table ( row * column) 

datatypes == user define only 1 value 
data strucute == user defin more on value
matrix = collection of datastrucute

PYTHON DATASTRUCTURE -- list, tuple, set, dict 

fun() 
---
LIST -->
---
append()  - add element or add value towards end of list
remove() - remove the 1st element 
copy() - copy from list to another list 
for loop - display all the element from the list 

pop() -- remove index level ( bydefaul will be last)
remove() -- remove from elment wise 
extend() -- exent one list to another list by pass an argument

function argument -->
	formal argument
	actual argument 



list is mutable or hashable 

fam() -- fam without argument or without parameter 
fam1(dad, mom) -- 2 argument 
fam2(dad, mom, son, daughter) -- 4 argument

parameter tunning --> 10   
windoe 10 to windown 11 ( hyperparamet tunning)

parameter tunning vs hyperparamenter tunning vs finetune

***** 14th *****

Lets continue with basic python
===
I will explain later how to create python environment varible
cmd - type python -- 
any user cmd - python 
===
help() -- when you execture this code 
	make sure user need to terminate work or else page will crash 
	 type quit the prompt which create by help()
===
python no constatn we have only variable
===
range understand only 3 argument not 4
=========
NUMBER SYSTEM -->
---
BINARY -- 2 VALUE -- 0 & 1 ( base 2) -- 0b
OCTAL -- 8 VALUE -- O to 7 (base 8 -- 0o
DECIMAL -- 10 value -- 0 to 9 (base 10) -- 0x
HEXADECIMAL -- 16 value -- (base 16) -- 0x
		0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, a, b, c, d, e , f 
---
bin(25) = 0b 11001 ( how it happend) 
==== completed ====
real time we will use many -- ipconfig
=====
1st -- temp veriable swap possible 
2nd -- using +, - 
3rd -- using binary number system 
	5 -- 6(0b101)
	6 -- 5 (0b111) 
4th -- using xor operator
5th -- (a,b = b,a)
=== we understand 5 ways to swap variable 
---
BITWISE OPERATOR -->
---
COMPLEMENT(~)  ( -ve values)
AND & ( and table)
OR | (or table)
XOR ^ xor table 
LEFT SHIFT <<  (gain the bit)
RIGHT SHIFT >> (loose the bit)

in memory we cannot store -ve value 
 ~10 
bitwise operator we are completed 
======= 
interview -- discuss between 2 brin 

 if your answer satisfy then 1st round clear
 commumincation & way of explanitn speaking very very importan

1- start - all - click anaconda folder - anaconda prompt 
2- pip install pkgname or (conda install pkgname)
	ex pip install numpy
3- jupyter notebook -- cell - !pip install pkgname 
	requirment alreay satisfied 

=======
package  = collection of module 
module = collection of function 
function == inbuild function & user define function 

from dmart.clothing import jeans
ml algorithm --> 
from sklearn.tree import decissiontreeclassifier 
=====

==== NUMPY =====

NUMPY == PACKAGE OR LIBRARY TO HANDLE MULTI DIMENSION ARRAY 
1D -- 1 DIMENSION ARRAY 
2D - 2 DIMENSION ARRAY 
ND - N DIMINSSION ARRARY

ARRAY -- TABLE ) (N. OF ROW * NO OF COLUMEN)

NUMPY --> DATASTRCTRUCTR + MATH CALCULATION == POWER FULL LIBRAR IN DS , DA, BA 

NUMPY --> NUMERICAL + PYTHON 

NUMPY -- DATA ANALYST, IMAGE ANALYST, TEXT ANALYST, GENE AI, AI PRJECT (WE REQURED) 

PIP INSTALL NUMPY 
ANCONDA -- YOU NOT REQUIRED ( INTERNALY INBUILD) 

pkg.__version__

how to convert list to array

np.arange() 
	1st arugment < 2nd arg
	
NUMPY vs PYTORCH 

NUMPY -- ARRAY
PYTORCH -- TENSOR (PYTHON + TORCH) = PYTORCH

	keep the document with you.


np.random.rand() -- it will get float values 

randint() & rand()
	np.random.rand() 
	
reshape() - elment must should calcuation

slicing, indexing in numpy 

: in numpy --> will give you rows 
, in numpy --> wil give specific element 

b[0:5] --> top 4 rows (0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd , 4th row)
b[0,5] --> disply the number from 0th row & 5th columsn 

numpy has 217 inbuild function 

from numpy import *  --> import all the function from backend 
from math import * 
select * from table;

mat[2,3]
mat[row, column]

how to print specific row, 
how to print specific colum [:,3] -- print only 3rd column	

n-1 formula will apply onlhen : is availabe 

table -- 

row wise -- forward & backwardslicing  (horizontal
column wise -- forwar & backward (vertical )

MASKIN OR FILTER 

NUMPY -->
by listening the classes you never get job 
listen -- once you 

**** 19th *****

NUMPY is one powerfull library in ds journey 

1- pick any images or download any images from google
2- image will converted to pixel
3- range of pixel 0-255
4- matplotlib -- library for visualization 
 

1- open a new jupyter
2- import numpy as np 
3- import matplolib.pyplot as plt
4- matplotlib inline

what if i dint show you the project 
	underst side by side 
		data agument -- deep learning 

main key concept of the project -->

1- image will convet to array
2- when araay values are change -- graphase change 
3- how we change array value 
4- 3d channel -- how red, green, blue can detected from image.
5- matplolatib.colormap
6- PIL -- to read any image ( jpeg, jpg, png) -- PIL

NUMPY -- ND ARRAY , ARR_TO_IMG, IMG_TO_ARR
PANDAS -- DATAFRAME 
MATPLOTLIB -- VISUALZIATION
SEABORN -- STATSTICS VISUALZIATION
SCIPY  - SCIENTFIC PYTHON ( STATS, TIME SEARIES)

null - cell is empty
non null - no missing vlaue 

excel sheet -- number or text 

number - numerical data 
text - categorical data 

dataset == numerical+categorical data 

pandas system alwasy bydefault consider categorical data - object 
so do we needt object to categorical 


never ever remove any null value 
but we fill null values with eda technique 
	transformer will introduce on eda part 

transformer --- transfer learning 
transfer learning in nlp --bert, gpt , t5 mode
transfoerm learning in computer vision -- imagenet, resnet, vgg16, vgg19 

RAW DATA -- dataset which contains missing value 
CLEAN DATA -- dataset which doesnot contain any missing value 

convert raw data - clean data -- ( data analyst using python)
after convert clean data -- go for predictive model 
predictive model - deployment 
deplyment - website will create
website -- will laucnh in the company webstei
customer use the website 
customer pay money -- compay will get benefit 

irctc.com 
3yr back -- probabiliyt of ticket confirmation 
now -- paytme, -- 80% -- then only you will book the tickest 

frontend -- irctct ( small tab  80% yes) 
	irctc -- pro

to build these project 
	 numpy, pandas 

DATA ENGINEERING

DATA ANALYST -- will always take care of structured data
DATA ENGINEER -- will always take care unstre ( video, straming, live, image)
DATA SCIENT -- PREDICTIVE MODEL ( 80% PROBABILITY) 

.describe() -- understan only numberical value or numerical information 

if you wante to get describe for categorical you have split to categroical then you need to find describe

**** 27th *****

I upload the csv file in google classroom & please download
open a new notebook


BPL --BELOW POVERTY LINE (50K) PER YEAR 
APL -- ABOVE POVERTY LINE (1L) PER YEAR

describe() -- we use this function for descriptive stats
	it will apply bydefault to numerical only


key point - how to change column name from the datafram
.transpose() - convert rows to columns
we alredy learnt how to divide the dataset to categorical & numerical 

dataset -- categorical 
dataset -- numerical 

practicle how to do multiplcation 

axis -0 : row
axis -1 : column

1- where interuer <2 ( govt need to halp on eduction)

	df.internet < 2

2- can you finout the country whose birthrate is > 40 

3- can you display the country which satisfy 
	intern < 2 & birthraet > 40 
4- unique() & nunique()
	
upto this revise what are topic we discussed

	1- business ( country gdp analsysi)
	2- import the dataset
	3- basic pandas function
		len(), head(), tail(), info(), describe(), isna(), isnull()
	4- how to chnage the attribute as per the business rquirement 
	5- how to add column along with math multiplication 
	6- how to drop column from the dataframe
	7- transpose() along with describe (row - columns) & colum -rows
	8- condiion internetet < 2 & birthrate>40 
	9- unique() & nunique()

plot the graph using 1 variable - univariate analysis

distplot() - distribution plot
displot() - histogram
plot the graph using 2 variable is call bivariate analysis 

outlier -- in stats outlier is the datapoint which is very far from 
other observation 

outlier is very dangerous 
outlier will impact  machine learning algorithm
outlier also called as -- anomaly detection 

what is outlier ? 
how to detect outlier ? 
	by visualization -- boxplot, scatter plot

if ml model build with irrelavatn attribute -
OVERFITTING OR MULTICOLLINEARIRY 

WE alwsy look for relavant attirbute for business 
	realvant attribute 

we need to do more practicle
kt (business knowledge)
1- variable identificaiton we are clear 
	regression model , classification model, clustering model 
	
what is model ? 

x, y, rel , irr 
y is continuous -- regression ( rel attribute) 
y is binary -- classificaiton (rel attribute)

	NUMERICAL VALUE ARE MISSING -- MEAN , MEDIAN, MODE STRATEGY 

	in dataset if categorical value are missing 
		mode strategy -- knn strategy 
						k= 1 k=2
if numerical values are missing - mean, median, mode
if categorical value are missing - mode or knn strategy
						99% we are using model
						knn 
		
6- variable imputation = TRANSFORMER 
	TRANSFORMNER IS THE TECHNIQUE TO CONVERT CATEGORICAL DATA TO NUMBER TO BUILD ML PREDICTIVE MODEL

	imputation technique or transformer 

dummy variable 
one hot encoder 
label encoder 
	
	from sklearn.preprocessing import labelencoder 
	
EDA THEORY COMPLETED 

7- VARIABLE CREATEION 
	1 CATEGOICE VARIABLE == 3 VARIABLE 
	GENERATE MORE VARIBLLES CUZ OF THE IMPUTATION TECHNIQUE
	
EDA THEORY --> FOUNDAMENTFO FOR ML 

ML model deals with dataset (excelsheet)
banking project -- bank dataset 
healthcare project - healtcare dataset 
insure project -- insurance dataset 

domain --> BFSI 
(BANKING , FINANCE, SERVICE, INSURANCE)
